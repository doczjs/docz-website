# Customizing

One of the greatest pains you can have when you're working with tools that allow you to create documentation and develop your components, is that it's ~~impossible~~ very difficult to customize and inject your brand. In most cases, you have just a few limited features to do that, or you need to create everything from scratch.

Docz was created with this pain in mind. In order to make customization simple and give you freedom and velocity without the need to create your things from scratch, we allow you to modify everything that you want, from the bundler configuration to a sidebar menu color.

In this section, we'll explain about what you need to know to do that!

## Project configuration

The first most important thing is your project configuration. As you now know, Docz is a zero-config tool. This is good, but our efforts to be zero-config are mainly to get you started. To make this possible we have a complete project configuration that can be modified to your own tastes.

Creating your own configuration is very easy: just add a `doczrc.js` file in the root of your project:

```js
// doczrc.js
import { myCoolPlugin } from 'docz-plugin-mycoolplugin'

export default {
  title: 'My Cool Project',
  description: 'This is my awesome documentation',
  theme: 'my-coolest-theme',
  themeConfig: {
    colors: {
      primary: 'tomato',
    },
  },
  modifyBundlerConfig: config => {
    /* do your magic here */
  },
  plugins: [
    myCoolPlugin()
  ]
}
```

Don't be scared with these properties, we'll explain them later, but you can see all the details about the file configuration in the [Project Configuration](/documentation/project-configuration) section.

## Document settings

Document settings can be something simple, but powerful. They should be defined in the top of the `.mdx` file using yaml and can be used to change the layout or the theme. By default there are some basic properties that all documents can have:

```markdown
---
name: My Document
route: /custom-route
menu: Documents
---
```

These properties are basic but good to help you improve your document navigation. They are pretty much self-explanatory, but here is their definition:

- `name` Define the name of your component.
- `route` Define the route of your component. By default, if you don't pass any route, we'll use some kinda slug that is a filepath of your file with a route format.
- `menu` You can group your documents into a single menu by changing this prop.

If we stopped here, perhaps you couldn't do many customizations with these properties. So, all documents can have arbitrary properties that you define and your theme will load them.

As of v0.12.4 the ordering of menus and submenus is done in `doczrc.js`, please [see the changelog for details](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/releases/tag/v0.12.4).

Example: you can define whether your document is a page with `100%` width or not, by setting a property like this:

```
---
name: My Document
fullpage: true
---
```

Now when you're creating your theme or maybe using some that use this setting, you'll have a full page document instead of a container.

This is very powerful and can give you flexibility when developing or using custom themes.

## Themes

By running docz and having your first `.mdx` file, you should see something like this in your browser:

What you see above is our [docz-default-theme](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/tree/master/packages/docz-theme-default). It's minimalist, but it has everything you need to start writing beautiful documentation.

### Creating themes

Themes are **one of the greatest things** in Docz. With them you can modify the entire layout of your documentation, define how you'll show your docs pages, menus and even create custom settings for each document.

If you want to create your own theme, we have a [full section](/documentation/creating-themes) talking about that. After choosing a theme or creating your own, you can set the theme path in your configuration file:

```js
// doczrc.js
export default {
  theme: 'my-coolest-theme',
}
```

### Modifying the existing theme

Creating a theme from scratch may be necessary depending on how big your project is and how much time you have. But this is not always the case: sometimes you just need to modify some colors, fonts, spacing, etc.

Docz makes it possible for you to create your own theme from scratch in a very simple way or just override some properties of the chosen theme:

```js
// doczrc.js
export default {
  themeConfig: {
    colors: {
      primary: 'tomato',
    },
    styles: {
      h1: {
        fontSize: 100,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

With just these few lines you can tweak your theme to match your styles:

The `themeConfig` property is what makes this possible. It's just an object that every theme can define and use within the theme components. This is very flexible because you can create your own theme with some default configuration and give the user the capability to modify to their own taste.

## Bundler config

Docz uses Webpack to bundle your source files into their final form. Using the `modifyBundlerConfig` property, you can modify the built-in Webpack configuration however you like. `modifyBundlerConfig` takes a function with the built-in Webpack configuration object as its argument. Whatever you return from that function will be used as the new Webpack configuration object.

One common use case is to add a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to add the `DirectoryNamedWebpackPlugin`.

```js
// doczrc.js
const merge = require('webpack-merge');
const DirectoryNamedWebpackPlugin = require('directory-named-webpack-plugin');

const webpackOverlay = {
  resolve: {
    plugins: [
      new DirectoryNamedWebpackPlugin({
        honorIndex: true,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      }),
    ],
  },
};

export default {
  modifyBundlerConfig: config => {
    return merge(config, webpackOverlay);
  },
};
```

You can see that the new configuration to be applied is stored in `webpackOverlay` and then merged into the existing configuration. This combined configuration is then returned and becomes the new Webpack configuration.

## Plugins

Plugins are helpful to speed up the development process. This concept is widely used nowadays in a lot of awesome tools because with it you can modify a bunch of processes and customize the project to your needs by just plugging in some packages.

Using a plugin in docz is easy. All you need to do is install the plugin that you want to use and call it in your project configuration:

```js
// docsrc.js
import { myPlugin } from 'docz-plugin-myplugin'

export default {
  plugins: [myPlugins()],
}
```

As you can see, a plugin is just a function passed inside an array. You can read more about how to create a plugin and the plugin API in the [Creating Plugins](/documentation/creating-plugins) section, and see all the available plugins in the [Plugins](/plugins) menu.
