# Getting Started

First off, try take a look and check out [docz's `examples` directory](https://github.com/doczjs/docz/tree/master/examples) for the full list of supported examples.

Start by adding **docz** as a dependency:

> There's also a [create-docz-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-docz-app), which you can be using to start new projects with docz even quicker, but it's totally independent from docz, therefore not officially supported. Once we strongly don't believe that it should be part of what we want to bring to the community as a project, but feel free to use it as much as you need, especially to replace `create-reract-app`, for example, to create new projects.

```sh
yarn add docz # react react-dom
```
or
```sh
npm install docz # react react-dom
```

> Note: Make sure you have `react` and `react-dom` correctly installed as dependencies with versions `>= 16.8.0`.

After installing Docz in your project, you may find it convenient to add three scripts to your `package.json` to run, build and serve your Docz website.

Note that this is an **optional step** :

```json
{
  "name": "next-gen-documentation",
  "scripts": {
    "docz:dev": "docz dev",
    "docz:build": "docz build",
    "docz:serve": "docz build && docz serve"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "docz": "latest",
    "react": "16.8.0",
    "react-dom": "16.8.0"
  }
}
```

You can now spin up your dev server by running:

```bash
yarn docz:dev # or yarn docz dev
```
or
```bash
npm run docz:dev
```

## Develop

With your dev server up, you can start writing your documentation. 

Docz uses the [**MDX**](https://mdxjs.com/) format that allows you to seamlessly write JSX inside your markdown files.

> Note that you **don't need to follow any file architecture or convention**. 
> You can just create your `.mdx` files and put them **anywhere in your project**.

With that in mind, let's create our first `.mdx` and give it a name and a route:

```markdown
---
name: Hello world
route: /
---

# Hello world

Hello, I'm a mdx file!
```

With your first `.mdx` document created, you can open your browser and visit `localhost:3000` to see something like this:

![Hello world preview](https://cdn-std.dprcdn.net/files/acc_649651/Y825GV)

We cover more of what you can do with Docz in [**Built-in Components**](/docs/built-in-components) and what you can do with _MDX_ in the [**Writing MDX**](/docs/writing-mdx) page.

## Build 

`yarn docz build` will generate a static site for your site in `.docz/dist/`.

You can try it out with `yarn docz serve` or by serving the generated site with your favorite static file server (e.g. `npx serve .docz/dist`). 

You can have `yarn docz build` emit to a different directory by providing a path to the `dest` field in your doczrc.js or from the command line : `yarn docz build --dest docs-site-directory`. 

## Deploy

The output of docz consists of static assets only. This allows you to deploy your generated `docz` site with any static site hosting provider you'd like. 

Start by building your site with `yarn docz build`, if you haven't provided a `dest` flag to your config then you will find your generated files in `.docz/dist` that you can copy to your server to deploy your site.

## Examples

You can check the complete list of docz examples [here](https://github.com/doczjs/docz/tree/master/examples).


## Migration Guide

This documentation is about **Docz v2**.

If you need to migrate your Docz project, please read the [**Migration Guide**](/docs/migration-guide).
