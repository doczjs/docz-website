# Customizing

One of the greatest pains when you're working with tools that allow you to create documentation, is that it's ~~impossible~~ very difficult to customize then.
In most cases, they have just few limited features for that or you need to create everything from scratch.

Docz was created with this pain in mind. In order to make customization simple and give you productivity, we allow you to modify everything that you want, from the bundler configuration to a sidebar menu color.
In this section, we'll explain about what you need to know to do that!

## Project configuration

Docz is a zero-config tool, but if you want to modify your project configuration you can do that too.
To create your own config just add a `doczrc.js` file in the root of your project:

```js
// doczrc.js
import { myCoolPlugin } from 'docz-plugin-mycoolplugin'

export default {
  title: 'My Cool Project',
  description: 'This is my awesome documentation',
  theme: 'my-coolest-theme',
  themeConfig: {
    colors: {
      primary: 'tomato',
    },
  },
  modifyBundlerConfig: config => {
    /* do your magic here */
  },
  plugins: [
    myCoolPlugin()
  ]
}
```

Don't be scared with these properties, we'll explain them later.

> Check all the details about the configuration in the [Project Configuration](/docs/project-configuration).

## Themes

Running Docz and creating your `.mdx`, you should have this:

What you see above is our [docz-default-theme](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/tree/master/packages/docz-theme-default).
It's minimalist, but it has everything you need to start writing your documentation.

### Creating themes

Themes are **one of the greatest things** in Docz. With them you can modify the entire layout of your documentation, define how you'll show your docs pages, menus and even create custom settings for each document.

To create your own theme, we have a [full section](/docs/creating-themes) talking about that. After choosing a theme or creating your own, you can set the theme path in your configuration file:

```js
// doczrc.js
export default {
  theme: 'my-coolest-theme',
}
```

### Modifying the existing theme

Creating a theme from scratch can be necessary depending on how big your project is and how much time you have.
But this is not always the case, sometimes you just need to modify some colors, fonts, spacing, etc.

Docz makes possible for you to create your own theme from scratch in a very simple way or just override some properties of your theme:

```js
// doczrc.js
export default {
  themeConfig: {
    colors: {
      primary: 'tomato',
    },
    styles: {
      h1: `
        font-size: 80px;
        margin-bottom: 10px;
      `,
    },
  },
}
```

With just few lines you can tweak your theme to match your styles:

The `themeConfig` property is what makes this possible. It's just an object that every theme can define and use inside it. This is very flexible because you can create your own theme with some default properties and give the user the capability to modify to their own taste.

## Plugins

Plugins are helpful to speed up the development process. This concept is widely used nowadays in a lot of awesome tools because with it you can modify a bunch of processes and customize the project to your needs by just plugging in some packages.

Using a plugin in Docz is easy. All you need to do is install the plugin and call it in your project configuration:

```js
// docsrc.js
import { myPlugin } from 'docz-plugin-myplugin'

export default {
  plugins: [myPlugins()],
}
```
