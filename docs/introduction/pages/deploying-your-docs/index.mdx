# Building your site

Now that you have a lot of knowledge about write your docs and you're a real badass, let's go to talk how you can build and deploy your documentation.

Like all the other things seen so far, build and deploy your documentation is very easy. The first thing that you need to do is run the build script created at your `package.json`:

```bash
$ yarn build
```

If everything that you did is right, this command will generate all static files for you in `.docz/dist` folder and you see something like that on your terminal:

If you want, you can change the build destination folder by changing the `dist` prop or your project configuration:

```js
// doczrc.js
export default {
  dest: '/my-dist-folder',
}
```

## Deploying

With your static files in hand, you can deploy your documentation wherever you want, is a simple process like host a static site.

So, if you understand nothing about deploys, we recommend a lot that you use the service we're using to host this doc that you're reading, called [Netlify](http://netlify.com/). Netlify is a really fantastic and very easy tool that you can deploy your application in an automatic way by running the deploy on every push from a branch in seconds.

First, after login or create a new account on Netlify, just create a _New site from git_:

Connect your Git service and pick some repository

After that, just fill settings like bellow, passing your build command and the destination folder:

That's it, now you have your documentation hosted in a domain with a very nice and quick deploy process configured.
