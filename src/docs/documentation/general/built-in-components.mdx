# Built-in components

Docz has built-in components that help you to document your things. Using the power of components and AST to parse and generate data for them, we can do a lot of things,
like render your components, create tables with contents, custom getters by traversing your file, etc. The sky is the limit here!

## Playground Component

With the `<Playground>` component, you can render your component inside a playground and see the code used:

```markdown
---
name: Button
---

import { Playground } from 'docz'
import { Button } from './Button'

# Button

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <Button>Click me</Button>
  <Button kind="secondary">Click me</Button>
</Playground>
```

As you see, `<Playground>` rendered your component in a blank state, and right below, displayed the code used to.
This can be very useful to test and develop your components in a good environment while you document it. The code below the component is also editable and the changes you make to that code will reflect live in the component above!

## Component Props

Maybe the most important thing when you write a component is know which properties it has.
However, keeping a good properties documentation of your component can be boring, because you need to write
the props specification and maintain the original props definition. And we know that to keep both in sync can be troublesome!

Docz offers a solution to this problem called the `<Props>`. It's a simple component that automatically gets the
props definition of your component and display them in a cool component.
Simple like that and works nicely with Flow and Typescript.

```markdown
---
name: Button
---

import { Playground, Props } from 'docz'
import { Button } from './'

# Button

<Props of={Button} />

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <Button>Click me</Button>
  <Button kind="secondary">Click me</Button>
</Playground>
```

The button that will display the props must have some annotation on the props. For non flow or typescript users this can be achieved with [`prop-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types)

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import t from 'prop-types'

const Button = ({ children, kind }) => {
  // Do something nice with the kind prop, like add a class with it
  return <button>{children}</button>
}

Button.propTypes = {
  /**
   * This is a pretty good description for this prop.
   */
  kind: t.oneOf(['primary', 'secondary', 'cancel', 'dark', 'gray']),
}
Button.defaultProps = {
  kind: 'primary',
}
export Button
```

If you have used `prop-types` you should now have a list of properties in a nicely formatted table:

The same can be achieved in typescript by adding comments to the props interface of your component:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

interface ButtonProps {
  /**
   * This is a pretty good description for this prop.
   */
  kind: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'cancel' | 'dark' | 'gray'
}
```
