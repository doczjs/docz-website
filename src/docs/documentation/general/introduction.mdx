# Introduction

Libraries that make our life easier coming up every day. Styleguides and design system are growing so fast. Today, tools that allow us to be quick and effective are really necessary. We can't lose time with tasks that should be trivial for us. Thinking about that **Docz** came out.

Documenting our things is one of the most important and heavy processes when you're creating something new. We waste a lot of time with unnecessary setups to build something that can represent and we want with our own style.

## Principles

You have many options available when you want to create your own design system or even just document your project. Looking over these alternatives, we borrowed the best ideas from each and came up with these principles:

- **Zero config and easy to learn.** No unnecessary build steps with confusing setups.
- **Blazing fast.** Built with performance in mind from the start.
- **Easy to customize.** Create something that will be easy to use and customize.
- **MDX based.** The best standard for writing documentation.
- **Pluggable.** Plugins are the best choice when you need a custom and flexible solution.

Now you know the core principles of Docz. Let's [get started](/docs/getting-started)!
