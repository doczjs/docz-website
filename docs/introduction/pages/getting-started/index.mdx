# Getting Started

## Installation

Being easy to use is one of our core principles. First, you need to install docz on your project using some package manager (we're assuming [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) here):

```bash
$ yarn add docz --dev
```

> ### Tips and tricks
>
> After you installed docz in your project, you may find it convenient to add two scripts in your `package.json` to run docz for you. This is an **optional step**:

```json
{
  "name": "mycoolproject",
  "scripts": {
    "docz:dev": "docz dev",
    "docz:build": "docz build"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "docz": "latest"
  }
}
```

Now you can spin up your dev server just by running:

```
$ yarn docz:dev
```

## Using

With your dev server up, you can start writing your documentation.

Docz uses [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification) as a standard format because of the flexibility of writing JSX inside markdown files. Really cool, no?

Note that you **don't need to follow any strict file architecture**. You can just create your `.mdx` files **anywhere in your project**.

So, let's create our first `.mdx` and give it a name:

```markdown
---
name: Hello world
---

# Hello world

Hello, I'm a mdx file!
```

With the server up and your first `.mdx` created, you can open your browser and visit `localhost:3000` and you should see something like this:

Easy, right?

Now that you know how to get started with docz, see the [next section](/introduction/writing-mdx) where we'll delve into MDX and how you can use it to write your documents.
