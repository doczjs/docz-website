# Creating Themes

One of the main features of Docz is if you want to create your own theme from scratch and just use data from parsed Docz you can do this in a very easy way. We provide a bunch of components that can help you to create your own theme without pain.

## Setting theme filepath

First of all, you need to set the path of your theme in the [Project Configuration](/documentation/project-configuration) by changing the `theme` property:

```js
// doczrc.js
export default {
  theme: 'src/my/theme/path',
}
```

## Creating your theme component

Then just create your component and export it  in a default way using the [`theme()`](/documentation/components-api) high order component as an enhancer:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { theme } from 'docz'

const Theme = () => <div>My badass docz theme</div>

export default theme()(Theme)
```

In fact, if you just create something like above you shouldn't have nothing too much useful to show. So, is important that you use the docz [built-in components](/documentation/components-api) that will help you to create beautiful documents pages and use the parsed data from data for mount menus and other things.

## Default theme configuration

Each theme has your own default `themeConfig` object that define whatever you want to turn customizable. It's very useful to set something like custom fonts, colors, spaces, some styles properties and other project global variables.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { theme } from 'docz'

const Theme = () => <div>My badass docz theme</div>

const themeConfig = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'tomato',
    secondary: 'khaki',
    gray: 'lightslategray',
  },
}

export default theme(themeConfig)(Theme)
```

By default, docz will use this object as default configuration and merge it with the `themeConfig` setting in the project configuration. Using together with the `<ThemeConfig>` component you can do a lot of things, like use css-in-js theming or retrieve props from your `themeConfig` in a deep render component.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { theme, ThemeConfig } from 'docz'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming'

const Theme = () => (
  <ThemeConfig>
    {config => (
      <ThemeProvider theme={config}>
        <div>My theme</div>
      </ThemeProvider>
    )}
  </ThemeConfig>
)

const themeConfig = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'tomato',
    secondary: 'khaki',
    gray: 'lightslategray',
  },
}

export default theme(themeConfig)(Theme)
```

## Preview of Documents

How we explain in the components API section, `<DocPreview>` is responsible to render the page of your document. It works like a `<Route>` component, but fetching and parsing data from your docs and creating a code splitting automatically for you.

Something very powerful here is that you can pass a `components`  as a prop, creating something like a map that will be used to render inside your `.mdx`, since all default tag written in mdx are converted to components, you can customize any HTML tag.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { theme, ThemeConfig, DocPreview } from 'docz'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming'

import * as components from './my-components'

const Theme = () => (
  <ThemeConfig>
    {config => (
      <ThemeProvider theme={config}>
        <DocPreview
          components={{
            page: components.Page,
            notFound: components.NotFound,
            render: components.Render,
            h1: components.H1,
            h2: components.H2,
            h3: components.H3,
            h4: components.H4,
            h5: components.H5,
            h6: components.H6,
            ul: components.List,
            loading: components.Loading,
            table: components.Table,
            pre: components.Pre,
            inlineCode: components.Code,
          }}
        />
      </ThemeProvider>
    )}
  </ThemeConfig>
)

const themeConfig = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'tomato',
    secondary: 'khaki',
    gray: 'lightslategray',
  },
}

export default theme(themeConfig)(Theme)
```

This is powerful because it forces you to write base components and create a default style for each one that will be used along the entire documents without the need to repeat none of them.

## Getting data from documents

So far you almost have an entire theme component. But just with the code above you will see just a document page without any link or information about all documents do you have. Create something like a menu with all documents is essential to create navigation.

You can do this easily by using the `<Docs>` and `<Link>` component.

The first one will give you information about all documents parsed from docz and the second one ability to navigate to them. First of all, create something like a `<Menu />` component (we using a menu just to illustrate here):

```js
// Sidebar.js
import React from 'react'
import { Docs, Link } from 'docz'

const Menu = () => (
  <Docs>
    {({ docs }) => (
      <ul>
        {docs.map(doc => (
          <li key={doc.id}>
            <Link to={doc.route}>
              {doc.name}
            </Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    )}
  </Docs>
)
```

Now you have a fully functional navigation to your documentation and you can simply use it your `<Menu />` component inside your theme:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { theme, ThemeConfig, DocPreview } from 'docz'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming'

import { Menu } from './Menu'
import * as components from './my-components'

const Theme = () => (
  <ThemeConfig>
    {config => (
      <ThemeProvider theme={config}>
        <div>
          <Menu />
          <DocPreview
            components={{
              page: components.Page,
              notFound: components.NotFound,
              render: components.Render,
              h1: components.H1,
              h2: components.H2,
              h3: components.H3,
              h4: components.H4,
              h5: components.H5,
              h6: components.H6,
              ul: components.List,
              loading: components.Loading,
              table: components.Table,
              pre: components.Pre,
              inlineCode: components.Code,
            }}
          />
        </div>
      </ThemeProvider>
    )}
  </ThemeConfig>
)

const themeConfig = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'tomato',
    secondary: 'khaki',
    gray: 'lightslategray',
  },
}

export default theme(themeConfig)(Theme)
```

You can still use this component to create other things like a search component, some custom page or whatever came in your mind.

## Using documents settings

Another really interesting thing that you can do when you're creating your own theme is using the component's map `<Page>` to customize the document preview depending on each document settings. Since each document can have your own settings defined in the top of `.mdx` and the `Page` component receive a prop called `doc` that's the current rendered doc, you can use these settings to create page variations, like that:

Let's suppose that some pages of your documentation should have a hero image, but some don't. You can give a `hero` property for your document, and base on that prop you'll show or not the hero:

```markdown
---
name: Hello world
hero: /my/hero/img.png
---

# Hello world

This is just a page!
```

After defining the hero page of your document, let's see how your `Page` component will look:

```js
import React from 'react'

import MyCoolHero from './MyCoolHero'

export const Page = ({ doc, children }) => (
  <div>
    {doc.hero && <MyCoolHero img={doc.hero} />}
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

Simple as that! Now you can create a lot of variations of your documents page.

How I told you, without pain and a lot of work your you can have a custom and very functional theme for your documentation. So, let's create your own theme and share with the community!

## Examples

If you wanna see an example of theme created, you can see the [source code](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz-website) of this website that was entire build using docz or the [source code](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/tree/master/packages/docz-theme-default) of `docz-theme-default`.
