# Documentation

Docz was built around a lot of programming concepts, techniques, tools, and with performance in mind to deliver a explicit project architecture. So, since we are thinking big and we can build something that will be really usefull for you, we are also thinking that you can learn and improve even more your process to write your documentation and create tools that can help other people too.

## Architecture

We took a long time to find out a model that enabled us to achieve all of our goals and build something maintanable and consistent. A simple model to be scalable, easy to understand and maintain. So, after a few tries, we came to this architecture:

Explaining it better: basically, you have a **bundler** that will get information of your **project configuration** and **plugins**, parse your entries using MDX and setup your theme with this configuration and data.

So, in the next sections we'll explain a bit more about how docz works and how you can customize even more your documentation and create your own plugins and themes!
