# Documenting Your Things

With all the capabilities of MDX in mind, we know that you can do a lot of things using this syntax and this is what we want to do, explore the full power of components and reliability of markdown to improve and facilitate your documentation flow.

## Built-in components

Docz has built-in components that help you to document your things. Using the power of components and AST parsing algorithms to work on the source data for these components, we can do a lot of things, like render your components on the fly, create tables with contents, custom getters by traversing your file, etc. The sky is the limit here!

### Component Playground

With the `<Playground>` component, you can render your component inside a playground and see the code used in docz in a single view:

```markdown
---
name: Button
---

import { Playground } from 'docz'
import { Button } from './Button'

# Button

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <Button>Click me</Button>
  <Button kind="secondary">Click me</Button>
</Playground>
```

Result:

As you see, `<Playground>` rendered your component in a blank state, and right below, displayed the code used to render it. This can be very useful to test and develop your components in a good environment while you document it.

### Table of Properties

Maybe the most important thing when you write a component is to know which properties it has. This is useful so you know what it can do and how you can modify its behavior or style. However, keeping a good properties documentation of your component can be boring, because you need to write the props specification and maintain the original props definition. And we know that to keep these two things in sync can be troublesome!

Docz offers a solution to this problem: the `<PropsTable>` is a simple component that automatically gets the props definition of your component and displays a table with all the values. Simple like that and works nicely with Flow and Typescript.

```markdown
---
name: Button
---

import { Playground, PropsTable } from 'docz'
import { Button } from './'

# Button

<PropsTable of={Button} />

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <Button>Click me</Button>
  <Button kind="secondary">Click me</Button>
</Playground>
```

And now you have a table of properties:

> ### Important
>
> To make `<PropsTable>` work, you need to export your component as the `default` export. This is a very bad limitation of React Docgen, but is something necessary right now!

You can see more about our built-in components on [Components API](/documentation/components-api).

## Just the beginning

As we mentioned before, the sky is the limit here. With MDX you have a lot of power and can do a lot of things. We think that this is just the beginning: by combining AST parsing inside the construction of the components, it's possible to come up with a lot of out the box ideas, and Docz is the ideal place to do that!
