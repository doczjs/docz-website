# Writing MDX

MDX is something really cool when it comes to writing documents and pages because it combines the readability of markdown with the expressivity and power of components. This is what makes MDX so powerful. According to the [specification](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification), it was developed because:

> ### Why MDX?
>
> In order to ensure a vibrant ecosystem and community, tooling needs to exist for formatting, linting, and plugins. This tooling requires a foundational specification and abstract syntax tree so that parsing is properly handled before transforming to JSX/Hyperscript/React/etc and potentially leveraging existing plugin ecosystems.

## Working with components

If you want to know more about how MDX works, parse and transpile files, it has a [specification](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification) that's a good read. But now, we'll assume that you just need to know that with MDX you can use your components inside your markdown files, just that!

But how? Let's take a look at how we can improve our `.mdx` created in the previous section by importing and using a component inside it:

```markdown
---
name: Hello world
---

import { Button } from './Button'

# Hello world

Hello, I'm still a mdx file, but now I have a button component!

<Button>Click</Button>
```

And, if you really have a `Button` component to import, you'll see something like this:

> ### Note
>
> It's important to know that by some mvp reasons, until now docz only works with React components. But stay calm, we working to bring Preact, Vue and some others libraries to docz!

## Using Remark and Rehype Plugins

Since MDX uses the [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)/[rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) ecosystems, you can use plugins to modify the AST on different stages of the process and make your documentation better.

To use plugins you just need set `mdPlugins` for remark plugins and `hastPlugins` for rehype plugins on your project configuration:

```js
import images from 'remark-images'
import emoji from 'remark-emoji'

export default {
  mdPlugins: [images, emoji]
}
```

## Using theme components

If you want to pass default theme components to some component that you import on your mdx, you can do that by passing the prop on the fly:

```markdown
---
name: Hello World
---

import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent'

<MyComponent components={components} />
```

Although MDX is very powerful, it's very simple too, so there's nothing more to know to work with MDX, it's just that. With this in mind, we open a whole new world of possibilities using markdown and components together and Docz can make possible to turn this experience better for you to write your docs.

So, now both we know how MDX works and what it can do, see how Docz can help you to [document your things](/introduction/documenting-your-things) by using our helper components!
