# Writing MDX

MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly use JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, like interactive charts
and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast.

More details about MDX in the [Official website.](https://mdxjs.com/)

## Working with components

For now, you only need to know that with MDX you can use your components inside markdown.
But how? Let's take a look at how we can improve our `.mdx` created before by importing and using a component inside it. The example below assumes we have a exported component named `Button` in a file named `Button.jsx`/`Button.tsx` located in the same folder as the `.mdx`-file we are editing.

```markdown
---
name: Hello world
---

import { Button } from './Button'

# Hello world

Hello, I'm still a mdx file, but now I have a button component!

<Button>Click</Button>
```

And, if you really have a `Button` component to import, you'll see something like this:

With MDX you can mix _React Components_ or _html-elements_ with regular markdown allowing you to either document your own components _or_ creating helper components that makes documentation easier. **Docz** comes with some prebuilt helper components which will help you document components faster, these are covered in [**Built-in components**](/docs/built-in-components).

> ### Note
>
> So far Docz only works with React components. But stay calm, we are working to bring Preact, Vue and some others libraries to Docz!
