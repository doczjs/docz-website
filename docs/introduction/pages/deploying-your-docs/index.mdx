# Building your site

Now that you know about writing your docs and you're a real badass, let's talk about how you can build and deploy your documentation.

Like all the other things seen so far, building and deploying your documentation is easy. The first thing that you need to do is run the build script created in your `package.json`:

```bash
$ yarn build
```

If everything goes well, this command will generate all static files for you in the `.docz/dist` folder and you will see something like this in your terminal:

If you want, you can change the build destination folder by changing the `dist` prop or your project configuration:

```js
// doczrc.js
export default {
  dest: '/my-dist-folder',
}
```

## Deploying

With your static files in hand, you can deploy your documentation wherever you want just like hosting any static site.

If you understand nothing about deploys, we highly recommend that you use the service we're using to host this doc that you're reading, called [Netlify](http://netlify.com/). Netlify is a really fantastic and easy tool that allows you to deploy your application in an automatic way by running the deploy on every push from a branch in seconds.

First, after login or create a new account on Netlify, just create a _New site from git_:

Connect your Git service and pick some repository:

After that, just fill settings like below, passing your build command and the destination folder:

That's all. Now you have your documentation hosted on a domain with a quick and easy deploy process configured.
