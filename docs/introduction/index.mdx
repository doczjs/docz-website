# Introduction

The open source world with tools that make developers life easier and the creation of styleguides and design systems are growing and evolving so fast. New and impressive things are arising every day. Tools that allow us to evolve together are really necessary nowadays. We can't create barriers or lose time with tasks that should be trivial for us.

To break barriers and facilitate the creation of tools was the purpose that Docz arose. Document our things is one of the most important and painful process that exist when you're creating something new. We lose a lot of our precious time with unnecessary setups to be able to build something that can represent and express what we want with our own style.

## Principles

You have many ways and alternatives if you want to create some documentation for your project or even create a big design system to help your partners. Looking over these alternatives available, we are getting the best parts of them and trying to fill the missing pieces of each one by building a tool with these principles:

- **Zero config and easy to learn.** No unnecessary build steps with confusing setups.
- **Blazing fast.** Built with performance in mind from the start.
- **Easy to customize.** Create something that will be easy to use and customize.
- **MDX Based.** Have the best standard to write documents.
- **Pluggable.** Plugins are the best choice when you need a custom and flexible solution.

Now you know our core principles. Go ahead and let's [Get it Started](/introduction/getting-started)!
