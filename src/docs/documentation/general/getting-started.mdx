# Getting Started

First off, try take a look and check out [docz's `examples` directory](https://github.com/doczjs/docz/tree/master/examples) for the full list of supported examples.

Start by adding **docz** as a dependency:

```sh
yarn add docz # react react-dom
```
or
```sh
npm install docz # react react-dom
```

> Note: Make sure you have `react` and `react-dom` correctly installed as dependencies with versions `>= 16.8.0`.

After installing Docz in your project, you may find it convenient to add three scripts to your `package.json` to run, build and serve your Docz website.

Note that this is an **optional step** :

```json
{
  "name": "next-gen-documentation",
  "scripts": {
    "docz:dev": "docz dev",
    "docz:build": "docz build",
    "docz:serve": "docz build && docz serve"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "docz": "latest",
    "react": "16.8.0",
    "react-dom": "16.8.0"
  }
}
```

You can now spin up your dev server by running:

```bash
yarn docz:dev # or yarn docz dev
```
or
```bash
npm run docz:dev
```

## Develop

With your dev server up, you can start writing your documentation. 

Docz uses the [**MDX**](https://mdxjs.com/) format that allows you to seamlessly write JSX inside your markdown files.

> Note that you **don't need to follow any file architecture or convention**. 
> You can just create your `.mdx` files and put them **anywhere in your project**.

With that in mind, let's create our first `.mdx` and give it a name and a route:

```markdown
---
name: Hello world
route: /
---

# Hello world

Hello, I'm a mdx file!
```

With your first `.mdx` document created, you can open your browser and visit `localhost:3000` to see something like this:

![Hello world preview](https://cdn-std.dprcdn.net/files/acc_649651/Y825GV)

We cover more of what you can do with Docz in [**Built-in Components**](/docs/built-in-components) and what you can do with _MDX_ in the [**Writing MDX**](/docs/writing-mdx) page.

## Build 

`yarn docz build` will generate a static site for your site in `.docz/dist/`.

You can try it out with `yarn docz serve` or by serving the generated site with your favorite static file server (e.g. `npx serve .docz/dist`). 

You can have `yarn docz build` emit to a different directory by providing a path to the `dest` field in your doczrc.js or from the command line : `yarn docz build --dest docs-site-directory`. 

## Deploy

The output of docz consists of static assets only. This allows you to deploy your generated `docz` site with any static site hosting provider you'd like. 

Start by building your site with `yarn docz build`, if you haven't provided a `dest` flag to your config then you will find your generated files in `.docz/dist` that you can copy to your server to deploy your site.

## Examples

You can check the complete list of docz examples [here](https://github.com/doczjs/docz/tree/master/examples).
