# Introduction

Libraries that make our lives easier are coming out every day. Styleguides and design systems are growing in popularity. Today, tools that allow us to be quick and effective in what we are doing are really necessary. We can't afford to lose time with tasks that should be trivial. This is why **docz** was created.

Documenting our things is one of the most important yet time-consuming processes when creating something new. We waste a lot of time with unnecessary setup in order to build something that has all the necessary content but also matches our own style.

## Principles

Whether you want to create a design system or just simple project documentation, you have many options available. Looking over these alternatives, we borrowed the best ideas from each and came up with these principles:

- **Zero config and easy to learn.** No unnecessary build steps with confusing setups.
- **Blazing fast.** Built with performance in mind from the start.
- **Easy to customize.** Create something that will be easy to use and customize.
- **MDX based.** The best standard for writing documentation.
- **Pluggable.** Plugins are the best choice when you need a custom and flexible solution.

Now you know the core principles of docz. Let's [get started](/introduction/getting-started)!
